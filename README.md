# Pong Game

## Description
This is a classic Pong game built using Python and the `turtle` graphics library. The game simulates the original Pong arcade game, where two players control paddles to bounce a ball across the screen. The game ends when a player reaches a predefined score.

## Features
- Single-player or two-player mode
- Continuous paddle movement using long-press functionality
- Customizable target score (e.g., first to 10 or 20 points)
- "Game Over" screen indicating which player won
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure

## Installation
To play this game, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps to Run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pong-game.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd pong-game
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    - The game uses Python's `turtle` module, which is part of the standard Python library, so no additional packages are required.
4. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How to Play
- Player 1 (left paddle) controls movement using the `W` (up) and `S` (down) keys.
- Player 2 (right paddle) controls movement using the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.
- The ball will bounce off the paddles and walls. The game ends when a player reaches the target score set at the beginning.

### Key Controls:
- **W**: Move the left paddle up
- **S**: Move the left paddle down
- **Up Arrow**: Move the right paddle up
- **Down Arrow**: Move the right paddle down
